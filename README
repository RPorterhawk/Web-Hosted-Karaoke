The purpose of this project is to develop a karaoke service that people can use over the web. The current problems with doing this are as follows
A.) Multiple apps or webpages are required to be used at once. Let's streamline that into one all-inclusive site or app.
B.) Sync issues are rampant. The music and the singer may sound like they're together to the singer, but everyone else will typically
    hear them as unsynced.
C.) Clipping. different apps and websites are trying to balance out and equalize their own sounds separately; then each client is trying
    to balance and equalize those separate things into one output. Thus, some things get clipped, depending on what volume each source is at.
D.) There is no "host" to control the situation like there might be at your favorite bar's karaoke night. Everyone has to simply be patient
    and not interfere with someone else's song. Should be easy, but humans do exist.
    
If all these problems are resolved by sending as much signal through one dedicated host that can manually, or through automation,
sync, equalize, organize, mute and unmute, distant friends can sing together, and possibly even remotely access, from their own home,
karaoke night with their friends who are out and about.
